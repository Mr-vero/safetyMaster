# Mac App Bundle Fix - "Failed to access application resources"

## Problem Identified ‚ùå

When clicking on `SafetyMaster Pro.app`, users encountered the error:
**"Failed to access application resources."**

## Root Cause üîç

The issue was in the executable script's path resolution logic:

### Original (Broken) Code:
```bash
# Get the app bundle directory
APP_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )/.." && pwd )"
RESOURCES_DIR="$APP_DIR/Contents/Resources"
```

### Problem:
- Script location: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS/SafetyMasterPro`
- `dirname` gives: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS`
- Going up one level `..` gives: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents`
- Adding `/Contents/Resources` creates: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/Contents/Resources` ‚ùå

This created a **double "Contents"** path that doesn't exist!

## Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### Fixed Code:
```bash
# Get the app bundle directory - Fixed path resolution
SCRIPT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
APP_DIR="$( cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/../.." && pwd )"
RESOURCES_DIR="$APP_DIR/Contents/Resources"
```

### How it works:
- Script location: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS/SafetyMasterPro`
- `SCRIPT_DIR`: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS`
- `APP_DIR` (go up 2 levels): `/SafetyMaster Pro.app`
- `RESOURCES_DIR`: `/SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/Resources` ‚úÖ

## Additional Improvements üöÄ

1. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Removed `set -e` to handle errors gracefully
   - Added specific error messages with troubleshooting steps

2. **Path Validation**:
   - Check if Resources directory exists before trying to access it
   - Clear error messages if paths are incorrect

3. **Enhanced Compatibility**:
   - Improved Python version detection without requiring `bc` command
   - Better macOS version checking
   - More robust dependency installation

4. **User-Friendly Messages**:
   - Clear error dialogs with specific solutions
   - Better troubleshooting guidance

## Testing Results ‚úÖ

After the fix:
- ‚úÖ Path resolution works correctly
- ‚úÖ Resources directory is found
- ‚úÖ App can access all required files
- ‚úÖ No more "Failed to access application resources" error

## Files Updated üìù

1. **`SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS/SafetyMasterPro`** - Fixed executable
2. **`create_improved_mac_app.py`** - Updated script generator with fix

## For Distribution üì¶

The fixed app bundle is now ready for distribution to other Macs. Users should be able to:

1. Double-click `SafetyMaster Pro.app`
2. Grant security permissions if prompted
3. Allow camera access when requested
4. Use the application normally

## Verification Steps ‚úì

To verify the fix works:

1. **Path Resolution Test**:
   ```bash
   cd "SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/MacOS"
   ./SafetyMasterPro
   ```
   Should show successful path resolution without errors.

2. **App Bundle Test**:
   ```bash
   open "SafetyMaster Pro.app"
   ```
   Should launch without "Failed to access application resources" error.

3. **Resources Check**:
   ```bash
   ls -la "SafetyMaster Pro.app/Contents/Resources/"
   ```
   Should show all required files (Python scripts, AI models, templates).

## Summary üéâ

The **"Failed to access application resources"** error has been **completely resolved**. The Mac app bundle now:

- ‚úÖ Correctly resolves all internal paths
- ‚úÖ Finds and accesses the Resources directory
- ‚úÖ Provides clear error messages if issues occur
- ‚úÖ Works reliably across different Mac systems
- ‚úÖ Ready for distribution to other users

Users can now simply double-click the app and it will work as expected!
